## Skills

**Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills**
- My analytical abilities were honed through structuring curricula to meet educational standards. This reflects the skills needed to understand user requirements and develop logical solutions in software development.
- Writing Reader’s Theatre scripts required systematic thinking to create engaging narratives, mirroring the process of developing use cases and software documentation.

**Technical Skills**
- Creating over 150 PowerPoint presentations, as well as producing over 30 teaching videos using OBS Studios showcases my ability to learn and utilize software tools to produce content, a useful skill when it comes to grasping new programming languages or development environments.

**Adaptability and Continuous Learning**
- Teaching students across a wide range of abilities required me to continuously adapt my teaching style and materials, which shows my ability to learn and adjust — key to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

**Examples of Relevant Projects:**
- <em>Reader’s Theatre Script Writing:</em> Crafting scripts involved not just writing, but understanding character development and plot progression—similar to designing user flows in software.
