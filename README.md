## Andrew Shakespeare

As a Makers Academy graduate, I specialise in Software and DevOps Engineering with proficiency in Python, JavaScript, SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and GitHub Actions. With over seven years of teaching experience, I've developed strong skills in design, management, adaptability, and patience, effectively educating diverse student groups and creating customised curricula. These skills have equipped me to solve problems efficiently and quickly pick up new skills as required. Eager to apply my background in teaching to a tech-driven career, I am passionate about pursuing a fulfilling role in backend development and contributing to innovative projects.

## Skills

**Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills**
- My analytical abilities were honed through structuring curricula to meet educational standards. This reflects the skills needed to understand user requirements and develop logical solutions in software development.
- Writing Reader’s Theatre scripts required systematic thinking to create engaging narratives, mirroring the process of developing use cases and software documentation.

**Technical Skills**
- Creating over 150 PowerPoint presentations, as well as producing over 30 teaching videos using OBS Studios showcases my ability to learn and utilise software tools to produce content, a useful skill when it comes to grasping new programming languages or development environments.

**Adaptability and Continuous Learning**
- Teaching students across a wide range of abilities required me to continuously adapt my teaching style and materials, which shows my ability to learn and adjust — key to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

**Examples of Relevant Projects:**
- <em>Curriculum Design Project:</em> This required understanding the end-users (students), much like user-centered design in software, ensuring the end product is suitable for its intended audience.
- <em>[Interactive Training for English Educators in China:](https://isacteach.notion.site/PD-Training-Story-based-Approach-2641fd5db8344f44b93073bce6ca1f60)</em> This training, centered on using storytelling to engage students in learning English, mirrors key software development skills. It highlights the importance of narrative in user engagement, akin to creating compelling content in software, and underscores adaptability and user-focused design, essential for effective software solutions.
- <em>Reader’s Theatre Script Writing:</em> Crafting scripts involved not just writing, but understanding character development and plot progression—similar to designing user flows in software.
- <em>Creating Educational Games:</em> Designing educational games with PowerPoint or other tools showcases my ability to engage users and enhance their experience, a core principle in interactive software design.
